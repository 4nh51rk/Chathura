# Chathura
Chathura was developed as a ASCII font earlier in 2009 in the name of Ezi Fonts which consists 42 Telugu ASCII fonts. Chathura Unicode Telugu font for Invitations, headings, display and web. It is a rectangular shaped uniform thickness font which suits print as well as web. Matching Latin characters are provided for a better texting.

Took suitable Latin characters from Rajdhani (devanagari) font developed by Indian Type Foundry. Thank you Shiva Nalleperumal.
